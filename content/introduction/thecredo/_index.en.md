## The Credo

Signal Cartel is a service corporation to all of New Eden. In this role, members are encouraged to treat all players with respect regardless of affiliation. In challenging situations, our goal is to look for a graceful resolution and set an example of dignity and friendship through our actions.

We embrace the attitude of a true explorer: we are friendly to others in our travels, neutral and never initiating aggression, and endeavoring at all times be perceived by the New Eden community as a non-threat. Although we never intentionally seek to harm, we may defend our friends and our ships. In suffering losses, we respond with good cheer and shed no tears. In this way, we aim to be recognized and respected by all across the cluster and left in peace to do our work.

Among our own ranks and with others, we are patient and generous with knowledge, ideas, and experiences. We foster a mentoring culture by answering questions, freely sharing experiences and learning resources, and when possible offering rookies one-on-one tutoring.

Specifically prohibited with your in-alliance character: Piracy, baiting, or scamming; initiating aggression on other players’ ships, pods, or deployed structures; sovereignty interference; participating in NPSI fleets; aggressive actions in support of PvP fleets including boosts, cynos, bumping, or target intel; use of mobile siphons; corp or other theft; placing bounties. Note: Ships, wrecks and drones abandoned in space are considered salvage and may be harvested. Abandoned ships may not be destroyed.

## Reputation: Our most valued asset

Whatever you do in New Eden, be aware that we regard our reputation as a friendly and neutral service corporation to be our most valued asset. 

**Make sure you understand what the Credo means.** Our goal is to look for a graceful resolution in challenging situations and set an example of dignity and friendship through our actions.

While the Credo forbids you to initiate aggression, you are absolutely allowed to defend yourself and destroy an aggressor’s ship. But be aware that if you destroy someone’s ship, [**you are required to report that kill to our CEO within 48 hours**](https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/25/policy-reporting-kills-and-concord-losses). If you shoot at someone in self-defense but don’t destroy their ship, it’s highly recommended that you check the killboard over the next few minutes to see if someone else killed that pilot. This is because EVE lists on the killmail everyone who aggresses a pilot within a few minutes in the same system. People are sometimes surprised to find themselves on killmails in these cases, but it happens more often that you’d think.  

## ARE CERTAIN MODULES OR RIGS CONSIDERED NON-CREDO COMPLIANT?

**Mynxee:**
I just want to point out that fits or modules need not be deemed "Credo compliant". All modules could be relevant for exploration. Modules that are commonly used for aggression can be used defensively. I often fit scramblers and webs with the thought if I can slow them down I might have a better chance of survival or a chance to level the playing field.

**The only thing to evaluate as "credo compliant" is our intentions on how we plan to use our ships and modules.**

**Defensively using modules.** If my aggressor has a MWD, I can shut it down with a scrambler and have a better chance of putting distance between us. This is especially true if I have an afterburner. This could allow me to take less damage because of damage falloffs or to break tackle. I can also apply damage more easily and level the playing field. A webifier can be used similarly along with electronic countermeasures (ECM, targeting damps, etc). I have an alpha Heron fit that can get out of a single Sabre bubble by pushing them back with scram, web and damp. I align out of the bubble and warp away. Its tank are the offensive modules.

**Sometimes the aggressor's ship should be blown up.** If I think the person will be a nuisance by returning I might make that harder for them by destroying their ship. I'll evaluate this by the area I am exploring and their affiliation. If the person attacking me is a day tripper like me, better to send them packing. If they are just defending their space, then I might resolve the situation differently (this is harder to interpret in the heat of the moment). We leave this decision to each member to make based on their conscience, role play and situation.

**We are not true pacifists though some like to play that way.** Our social contract with New Eden is that we won't be the aggressor or seek to harm. This is to achieve our goal as a neutral and trusted entity. Our Credo is not a commentary on how the game should be played. There is a spectrum of interpretations by our members based on their individual approaches to the game. Some of our members play as true pacifists and prefer not fighting back. Some fly with the expectation to be left alone because we should not be considered a threat, but if attacked there are options on how to respond. I'm comfortable with members interpretations and approaches to the Credo as long as it achieves our primary goal. What I'm not comfortable with is members judging other member's interpretations.

**Make them think twice.** Following the previous point. I don't fly as a true pacifist. I like to have options on how I'll respond. Personally, I'd prefer for our reputation to let us move freely through out New Eden (yes, I know this would be boring) because it would achieve something unique. I know this is far from a possibility because we play a PvP game and not everyone will know about us or truly trust us. When my reputation fails, I'd prefer for others to not think I'm easy prey. I want them to carefully consider attacking me. Again, this is MY application of the Credo and not THE WAY. Those that play closer to a true pacifist are valid options in my mind.

**Thrice Hapus:**
Here are three questions you could ask yourself regarding what action to take in pretty much any situation:

**Is it specifically prohibited by the Credo?** If yes, stop.

**Is YOUR INTENT misaligned with the spirit and intent of the Credo?** If yes, stop.

**Could it affect our rep in the eyes of third party observers?** If yes, stop.

I should say something about intent. Some people equate conforming to the Credo with doing good in New Eden, but the Credo is not necessarily about doing GOOD. It is about conducting yourself in a civil manner while remaining neutral. Neutrality is the foundation upon which our rep sits. If you examine many of the Credo questions asked in these forums under the harsh light of neutrality, the action you should take in any situation probably becomes even clearer...although not necessarily easier.
