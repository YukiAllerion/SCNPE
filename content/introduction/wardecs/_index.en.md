## What is a "War Dec"?

Other corporations can issue war declarations (“wardecs”) against Signal Cartel when we are eligible by having structures anchored in space. Structures will be anchored by corps within the alliance for short or long term use, so our war dec eligibility can change without notice. 

You will get notifications in game when we are wardecced or when a wardec is invalidated because the wardeccer chose not to extend it. An active war means that you are a legal target in highsec for any corps/alliances who have declared war against us. The “space police,” CONCORD, will not punish them for aggressing us or destroying our ships or pods. 

## Leadership's stance about wars
Leadership is indifferent to wardecs. Our position is that as explorers, we should mainly be operating where wardeccers are not...they tend to stick to the trade hubs and the pipe of systems between Jita, Amarr, and Dodixie. 

While we do what we can to make new players aware of the situation and give them the help they need to avoid losing ships and pods during wars, in the end we don’t care much what members do with that awareness. 

Truth is, Signal Cartel is an exploration corp. There is very little reason for explorers to be in high security space. Virtually all the exciting content for an explorer is in lowsec, nullsec or wormholes. Wars don’t matter there; the locals will shoot you, war or not. We have no issues with our members doing anything in highsec, but we have limited sympathy when those members die to wardeccers.

**We keep structures anchored in the alliance specifically so that we remain intentionally eligible for wars, thus discouraging activities outside of exploration for our members. We are first and foremost an exploration corp.** We will continue to regard an active wardec as an opportunity to hone our piloting skills, and we will carry on as before.

**It is Signal Cartel policy to not harass, bait, or initiate conflict with wardeccers. If you want to know why, review the section in the DII on surviving wardecs.** (If you don’t know what the DII is, there’s a clue in both the link above and the in-game Corp chat MOTD (Message of the Day).

The ONLY acceptable response to wardeccers are Hugs Fleets, which involve engaging war deccers in harmless fun and silliness with snowballs and fireworks. We do things differently around here :-)

Your actions can impact our reputation for good or ill, so think before you act. Our reputation is our most valuable asset; conduct which negatively impacts it has consequences. When in doubt about how to respond to any situation, ask in Alliance chat about the response you are considering or wondering about.
