# Signal Cartel: New Members Guide

![Homepage Image](/images/homepagebanner.png)

Welcome to Signal Cartel! This guide for new members will make your start a little easier. This guide aims to be a quickstart guide to corp life. It assumes that you are not only new to Signal Cartel but new to EVE in general. More experienced players can still benefit from much of the information presented below. 

To learn more, you will find a ton of information on [**Our Forums**](https://forums.eve-scout.com/)  and you are highly encouraged to pay it a visit every now and then to stay on top of what is happening in your corporation.

It is highly recommended that you bookmark the [**Directory of Important Information**](https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/8/directory-of-important-information) on our forums. The DII, as it is commonly known, provides a categorized list of links to the most important information you will need as a Signaleer. Take some time to skim its contents...when you have a question about our policies, programs, or other details of corp life, you can most probably find it there.
